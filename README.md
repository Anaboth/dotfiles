If you are here it seems you know how to configure your own Arch (or any other Linux distro).

```
For i3 is used i3-gaps, i3blocks-gaps-git, conky and xfce4-panel
For herbstlufwm is used dzen2 and lemombar
For dwm is used only dwm and xfce4-terminal as terminal emulator
```

Ok mom, I'll learn how to configure and use urxvt
