If you are here it seems you know how to configure your own Arch (or any other Linux distro).

```
For i3 is used i3-gaps, i3blocks-gaps-git, conky and xfce4-panel
For herbstlufwm is used dzen2
For dwm is used only dwm
Terminal emulator used is URxvt for all
```

> Herbstlufwm is not really updated (maybe 1 year that I don't use it anymore)
