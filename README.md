If you are here it seems you know how to configure your own Arch (or any other Linux distro).

## I'm not here to teach you, so if you need any help using any of my config files, go for google.com, don't ask me anything, as soon as you are using anything from here, you should know how to properly use any file in here

```
For i3 is used i3-gaps, i3blocks-gaps-git, conky and xfce4-panel
For herbstlufwm is used dzen2
For dwm is used only dwm
For 2bwm is used only 2bwm and its dependencies
Terminal emulator used is URxvt for all
```

> Herbstlufwm is not really updated (maybe 2 year that I don't use it anymore)
